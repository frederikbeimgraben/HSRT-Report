# Docker Environment Configuration Example
# =========================================
# Copy this file to .env and adjust values as needed

# User ID and Group ID for the Docker container user
# These should match your local user to avoid permission issues
# You can get your current values by running:
#   echo "HOST_UID=$(id -u)"
#   echo "HOST_GID=$(id -g)"
HOST_UID=1000
HOST_GID=1000

# Note: When using 'make docker-build', these values are automatically
# detected and passed to docker-compose, so you don't need a .env file.
# This file is only needed if you run docker-compose directly.
