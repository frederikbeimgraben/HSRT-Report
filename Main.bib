	abstract = {Sportler, die repetitiv milde Schädelhirntraumen ({SHT}) erlitten haben, zeigen neben neurokognitiven und motorischen Defizite auch ein erhöhtes Risiko zur Entwicklung einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung ({McKee} et al. 2009, Tremblay et al. 2012, Deak et al. 2016), wie auch eine erhöhte {GABA}-erge Aktivität mit entsprechender Inhibition der {LTP} (Tremblay et al. 2011). Eine verminderte {LTP} führt bei Personen mit repetitiven {SHTs} zu einer Verminderung des motorischen Lernens (De Beaumont et al. 2012). Die transkranielle Gleichstromstimulation ({tDCS}) ist eine nicht-invasive und sichere Methode zur Neuromodulation (Poreizs et al. 2007) und führt zu einer Verminderung von {GABA}-ergen neuronalen Funktionen (Stagg et al. 2011b, Stagg et al. 2011d). Ziel der vorliegenden Studie ist es zu untersuchen, (1) ob bei jungen klinisch gesunden Probanden, die repetitive milde {SHTs} im Rahmen von sportlichen Aktivitäten erlitten haben, subklinische kognitive und motorische Defizite vorliegen und (2) ob anodale {tDCS} über dem primären Motorkortex zu einer Verbesserung der motorischen Lernfähigkeit führt. Insgesamt wurden 35 junge Probanden (20 gesunde Kontrollprobanden und 15 Probanden mit mindestens zwei milden {SHTs} im Rahmen einer sportlichen Aktivität) untersucht. Neben einer neurokognitiven Testung erfolgten in einem einwöchigen Abstand zwei Sitzungen mit motorischen Testungen. Zuerst wurde jeweils das explizite motorische Lernen, mittels Force Motortask, und dann das implizite Lernen, mittels Serial Reaction Time Task ({SRTT}), getestet. Nach randomisierter Zuteilung erfolgte an einem Termin eine anodale und am anderen Termin eine Scheinstimulation über dem linken primären motorischen Kortex während dem Force Motortask.
In der Patientengruppe zeigten sich im Vergleich zur Kontrollgruppe signifikante kognitive Defizite im Bereich des Kurzzeitgedächtnisses (p = 0,03) und der verbalen Flüssigkeit (p {\textless} 0,05). Desweiteren wurde durch die anodale Stimulation das explizite Lernen inhibiert (p = 0,02). Anodale offline {tDCS} führt zu einer initialen, nicht signifikanten Verbesserung des impliziten motorischen Lernens. Anodale {tDCS} zeigte in der Kontrollgruppe weder auf das explizierte noch das implizierte Lernen einen Effekt.
Dies ist die erste Studie, die den stimulatorischen Effekt auf das motorische Lernen von Probanden, die repetitiv milde {SHTs} erlitten haben, untersucht. Es sind somit zukünftig weitere Forschungen zur Pathophysiologie und möglichen chronischen Folgezuständen nach repetitiven milden {SHTs}, sowie zum Einfluss anodaler {tDCS} auf motorische Fähigkeiten in dieser Probandengruppe nötig.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung. Die menschliche Intelligenz gehört zu den bestuntersuchten psychologischen Merkmalen, in denen interindividuelle Differenzen bestehen. Die mehr als 100jährige Forschungsgeschichte hat einen hoch belastbaren Wissensstand hervorgebracht; dieser umfasst die Definition, die Psychometrie, die (ontogenetische) Entwicklung, die Struktur, die Vorhersagekraft für real-life-Variablen, das Wissen über elementar-kognitive, verhaltensgenetische und neurobiologische Grundlagen der Intelligenz, u.v.m. Jüngst steht zudem die Frage des ‚enhancements‘ der Intelligenz im Fokus, eine Frage, die nicht zuletzt durch die aktuelle philosophische Strömung des Transhumanismus stark an Bedeutung gewinnt. Der Transhumanismus nimmt eine substanzielle Erhöhung (enhancement) von Fähigkeiten und anderen (auch) psychologischen Eigenschaften des Menschen ins Zentrum und postuliert, dass ein soziokultureller Fortschritt – und letztlich das Überlegen des Homo Sapiens und unseres Planeten – erst durch technologischen Fortschritt ermöglicht werde. Viele Transhumanisten stellen eine substanzielle Steigerung der Intelligenz in den Vordergrund, die primär durch (neuro–)‌technologische und pharmakologische Maßnahmen zu bewerkstelligen seien. Diese Debatten sind jedoch oft gekennzeichnet durch übertrieben optimistische Annahmen der Möglichkeiten moderner neurowissenschaftlicher Methoden bei gleichzeitiger Vernachlässigung der potenziellen negativen Folgen für das Individuum, für die Gesellschaften und insgesamt für unsere Spezies. Im gegenständlichen Überblicksbeitrag werden behaviorale, neuroelektrische und pharmakologische Methoden im Hinblick auf ihr aktuelles Potenzial einer Steigerung der individuellen Intelligenz analysiert. Die zwischenzeitlich zu diesen Fragen vorliegenden experimentellen Studien, sowie verfügbare Metaanalysen lassen allerdings den Schluss zu, dass bislang keine der gegenwärtig verfügbaren Methoden das Potenzial haben, die individuelle Intelligenz substanziell zu steigern. Und selbst falls solche möglicherweise in absehbarer Zeit zur Verfügung stünden, müssen zuvor sowohl individuelle als auch gesellschaftliche (negative) Konsequenzen einer kritischen Analyse unterzogen werden. Diese sind Gegenstand einer abschließenden Diskussion.},

	abstract = {Here we review the usefulness of transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) in modulating cortical networks in ways that might produce performance enhancements in healthy human subjects. To date over sixty studies have reported significant improvements in speed and accuracy in a variety of tasks involving perceptual, motor, and executive processing. Two basic categories of enhancement mechanisms are suggested by this literature: direct modulation of a cortical region or network that leads to more efficient processing, and addition-by-subtraction, which is disruption of processing which competes or distracts from task performance. Potential applications of {TMS} cognitive enhancement, including research into cortical function, rehabilitation therapy in neurological and psychiatric illness, and accelerated skill acquisition in healthy individuals are discussed, as are methods of optimizing the magnitude and duration of {TMS}-induced performance enhancement, such as improvement of targeting through further integration of brain imaging with {TMS}. One technique, combining multiple sessions of {TMS} with concurrent {TMS}/task performance to induce Hebbian-like learning, appears to be promising for prolonging enhancement effects. While further refinements in the application of {TMS} to cognitive enhancement can still be made, and questions remain regarding the mechanisms underlying the observed effects, this appears to be a fruitful area of investigation that may shed light on the basic mechanisms of cognitive function and their therapeutic modulation.},

We have conducted a mini-review of the literature to first briefly summarize the growing amount of data from clinical trials assessing the efficacy of {tDCS}, focusing exclusively on learning and memory performances in healthy human subjects and in patients with depression, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders. We then discuss these findings in the context of the strikingly few studies resulting from animal research.

	abstract = {Brain stimulation techniques, including transcranial direct current stimulation ({tDCS}), were identified as promising therapeutic tools to modulate synaptic plasticity abnormalities and minimize memory and learning deficits in many neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we revised the effect of {tDCS} on the modulation of neuroplasticity and cognition in several animal disease models of brain diseases affecting plasticity and cognition. Studies included in this review were searched following the terms ("transcranial direct current stimulation") {AND} (mice {OR} mouse {OR} animal) and according to the {PRISMA} statement requirements. Overall, the studies collected suggest that {tDCS} was able to modulate brain plasticity due to synaptic modifications within the stimulated area. Changes in plasticity-related mechanisms were achieved through induction of long-term potentiation ({LTP}) and upregulation of neuroplasticity-related proteins, such as c-fos, brain-derived neurotrophic factor ({BDNF}), or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors ({NMDARs}). Taken into account all revised studies, {tDCS} is a safe, easy, and noninvasive brain stimulation technique, therapeutically reliable, and with promising potential to promote cognitive enhancement and neuroplasticity. Since the use of {tDCS} has increased as a novel therapeutic approach in humans, animal studies are important to better understand its mechanisms as well as to help improve the stimulation protocols and their potential role in different neuropathologies.},

	abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation ({tDCS}) has been studied extensively for its potential to enhance human cognitive functions in healthy individuals and to treat cognitive impairment in various clinical populations. However, little is known about how {tDCS} modulates the neural networks supporting cognition and the complex interplay with mediating factors that may explain the frequently observed variability of stimulation effects within and between studies. Moreover, research in this field has been characterized by substantial methodological variability, frequent lack of rigorous experimental control and small sample sizes, thereby limiting the generalizability of findings and translational potential of {tDCS}.The present manuscript aims to delineate how these important issues can be addressed within a neuroimaging context, to reveal the neural underpinnings, predictors and mediators of {tDCS}-induced behavioral modulation. We will focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), because it allows the investigation of {tDCS} effects with excellent spatial precision and sufficient temporal resolution across the entire brain. Moreover, high resolution structural imaging data can be acquired for precise localization of stimulation effects, verification of electrode positions on the scalp and realistic current modeling based on individual head and brain anatomy. However, the general principles outlined in this review will also be applicable to other imaging modalities.Following an introduction to the overall state-of-the-art in this field, we will discuss in more detail the underlying causes of variability in previous {tDCS} studies. Moreover, we will elaborate on design considerations for {tDCS}-{fMRI} studies, optimization of {tDCS} and imaging protocols and how to assure high-level experimental control. Two additional sections address the pressing need for more systematic investigation of {tDCS} effects across the healthy human lifespan and implications for {tDCS} studies in age-associated disease, and potential benefits of establishing large-scale, multidisciplinary consortia for more coordinated {tDCS} research in the future.We hope that this review will contribute to more coordinated, methodologically sound, transparent and reproducible research in this field. Ultimately, our aim is to facilitate a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which {tDCS} modulates human cognitive functions and more effective and individually tailored translational and clinical applications of this technique in the future.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Noninvasive brain stimulation ({NIBS}) has shown benefits for cognitive function in older adults. However, the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation ({tDCS}) on cognitive function in older adults are inconsistent across studies, and the evidence for {tDCS} has limitations. We aim to explore whether {tDCS} can improve cognitive function and different cognitive domains (i.e., learning and memory and executive function) in adults aged 65 years and older with and without mild cognitive impairment and to further analyze the influencing factors of {tDCS}. Methods: Five English databases ({PubMed}, Cochrane Library, {EMBASE}, Web of Science, the cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [{CINAHL}]) and four Chinese databases were searched from inception to October 14, 2023. Literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were completed independently by two reviewers. All statistical analyses were conducted using {RevMan} software (version 5.3). Standardized mean difference ({SMD}) along with a 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) was used to express the effect size of the outcomes, and a random-effect model was also used. Results: A total of 10 {RCTs} and 1,761 participants were included in the meta-analysis, and the risk of bias in those studies was relatively low. A significant effect favoring {tDCS} on immediate postintervention cognitive function ({SMD} = 0.16, Z = 2.36, p = 0.02) was found. However, the effects on immediate postintervention learning and memory ({SMD} = 0.20, Z = 2.00, p = 0.05) and executive function ({SMD} = 0.10, Z = 1.22, p = 0.22), and 1-month postintervention cognitive function ({SMD} = 0.12, Z = 1.50, p = 0.13), learning and memory ({SMD} = 0.17, Z = 1.39, p = 0.16), and executive function ({SMD} = 0.08, Z = 0.67, p = 0.51) were not statistically significant. Conclusion: {tDCS} can significantly improve the immediate postintervention cognitive function of healthy older adults and {MCI} elderly individuals. Additional longitudinal extensive sample studies are required to clarify the specific effects of {tDCS} on different cognitive domains, and the optimal {tDCS} parameters need to be explored to guide clinical practice.},

	abstract = {A fully autonomous intracranial device is built to continually record neural activities in different parts of the brain, process these sampled signals, decode features that correlate to behaviors and neuropsychiatric states, and use these features to deliver brain stimulation in a closed-loop fashion. In this paper, we describe the sampling and stimulation aspects of such a device. We first describe the signal processing algorithms of two unsupervised spike sorting methods. Next, we describe the {LFP} time-frequency analysis and feature derivation from the two spike sorting methods. Spike sorting includes a novel approach to constructing a dictionary learning algorithm in a Compressed Sensing ({CS}) framework. We present a joint prediction scheme to determine the class of neural spikes in the dictionary learning framework; and, the second approach is a modified {OSort} algorithm which is implemented in a distributed system optimized for power efficiency. Furthermore, sorted spikes and time-frequency analysis of {LFP} signals can be used to generate derived features (including cross-frequency coupling, spike-field coupling). We then show how these derived features can be used in the design and development of novel decode and closed-loop control algorithms that are optimized to apply deep brain stimulation based on a patient's neuropsychiatric state. For the control algorithm, we define the state vector as representative of a patient's impulsivity, avoidance, inhibition, etc. Controller parameters are optimized to apply stimulation based on the state vector's current state as well as its historical values. The overall algorithm and software design for our implantable neural recording and stimulation system uses an innovative, adaptable, and reprogrammable architecture that enables advancement of the state-of-the-art in closed-loop neural control while also meeting the challenges of system power constraints and concurrent development with ongoing scientific research designed to define brain network connectivity and neural network dynamics that vary at the individual patient level and vary over time.},

Some studies found that {tES} has weak but positive eﬀects on brain physiology, cognition, or assessment performance, which has attracted massive public interest. We present the ﬁrst meta-analytic test of the hypothesis that {tES} in a learning phase is more eﬀective than {tES} in an assessment phase. The meta-analysis included 246 eﬀect sizes from studies on language or mathematical competence. The eﬀect of {tES} was stronger when stimulation was administered during a learning phase (d = 0.712) as compared to stimulation administered during test performance (d = 0.207). The overall eﬀect was stimulation-dosage speciﬁc and, as found in a previous meta-analysis, signiﬁcant only for anodal stimulation and not for cathodal. The results provide evidence for the modulation of long-term synaptic plasticity by {tES} in the context of practically relevant learning tasks and highlight the need for more systematic evaluations of {tES} in educational settings.},

Recently, there has been an increasing effort in improving {WM} through noninvasive brain stimulation ({NIBS}), especially transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation ({tDCS}/{tACS}). Studies suggest that {tDCS} and {tACS} can modulate {WM} performance, but large variability in research approaches hinders the identification of optimal stimulation protocols and interpretation of study results. Moreover, it is unclear whether {tDCS} and {tACS} differentially affect {WM}. Here, we summarize and compare studies examining the effects of {tDCS} and {tACS} on {WM} performance in healthy adults. Following {PRISMA}-selection criteria, our systematic review resulted in 43 studies (29 {tDCS}, 11 {tACS}, 3 both) with a total of 1826 adult participants. For {tDCS}, only 4 out of 23 single-session studies reported effects on {WM}, while 7 out of 9 multi-session experiments showed positive effects on {WM} training. For {tACS}, 10 out of 14 studies demonstrated effects on {WM}, which were frequency dependent and robust for frontoparietal stimulation. Our review revealed no reliable effect of single-session {tDCS} on {WM} but moderate effects of multi-session {tDCS} and single-session {tACS}. We discuss the implications of these findings and future directions in the emerging research field of {NIBS} and {WM}.},

Brain stimulation shows potential to enhance these functions, but studies show variable effects. Previous studies have tried to identify responders and non-responders through correlations between behavioral change and baseline parameters, but results lack generalization to independent cohorts. We propose a method to predict an individual’s likelihood of benefiting from stimulation, based on baseline performance of a sequential motor task. Our results show that individuals with less efficient learning mechanisms benefit from stimulation, while those with optimal learning strategies experience none or even detrimental effects. This differential effect, first identified in a public dataset and replicated here in an independent cohort, was linked to one’s ability to integrate task-relevant information and not age. This study constitutes a further step towards personalized clinical-translational interventions based on brain stimulation.},

	abstract = {Background
After two decades of transcranial direct current stimulation ({tDCS}) research, it is still unclear which applications benefit most from which {tDCS} protocols. One prospect is the acceleration of learning, where previous work has demonstrated that anodal {tDCS} applied to the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ({rVLPFC}) is capable of doubling the rate of learning in a visual camouflaged threat detection and category learning task.
Goals
Questions remain as to the specific cognitive mechanisms underlying this learning enhancement, and whether it generalizes to other tasks. The goal of the current project was to expand previous findings by employing a novel category learning task.
Methods
Participants learned to classify pictures of European streets within a discovery learning paradigm. In a double-blind design, 54 participants were randomly assigned to 30 min of {tDCS} using either 2.0 {mA} anodal (n = 18), cathodal (n = 18), or 0.1 {mA} sham (n = 18) {tDCS} over the {rVLPFC}.
Results
A linear mixed-model revealed a significant effect of {tDCS} condition on classification accuracy across training (p = 0.001). Compared to a 4.2\% increase in sham participants, anodal {tDCS} over F10 increased performance by 20.6\% (d = 1.71) and cathodal {tDCS} by 14.4\% (d = 1.16).
Conclusions
These results provide further evidence for the capacity of {tDCS} applied to {rVLPFC} to enhance learning, showing a greater than quadrupling of test performance after training (491\% of sham) in a difficult category learning task. Combined with our previous studies, these results suggest a generalized performance enhancement. Other tasks requiring sustained attention, insight and/or category learning may also benefit from this protocol.},

Newer noninvasive stimulation techniques also have the potential to be used as enhancements. Neuroenhancements raise deep ethical concerns about safety, compromised character, distributive justice, and coercion. The ethical concerns apply to adults in general, but also in unique ways to children who are not completely autonomous and to soldiers who choose to relinquish some of their autonomy. There are no easy solutions to these ethical concerns. Prohibition of enhancements is not a viable option.

Cocaine and amphetamine are modern cases of drugs initially enthusiastically acclaimed for enhancing cognition and mood. Today, an increasing number of healthy people are reported to use cognitive-enhancing drugs, as well as other interventions, such as non-invasive brain stimulation, to maintain or improve work performance. Cognitive-enhancing drugs, such as methylphenidate and modafinil, which were developed as treatments, are increasingly being used by healthy people. Modafinil not only affects ‘cold’ cognition, but also improves ‘hot’ cognition, such as emotion recognition and task-related motivation. The lifestyle use of ‘smart drugs’ raises both safety concerns as well as ethical issues, including coercion and increasing disparity in society. As a society, we need to consider which forms of cognitive enhancement (e.g. pharmacological, exercise, lifelong learning) are acceptable and for which groups under what conditions and by what methods we would wish to improve and flourish.},

Meanwhile, empirical evidence shows modest prevalence and guarded public attitudes toward the neuroenhancement use of stimulants. In this Perspective, we argue that the dissonance between the prescriptions of ethical theories (what ought to be) and empirical evidence (what is) has impaired our understanding of neuroenhancement practices. This dissonance is a result of three common errors in research on the ethics of neuroenhancement: (1) expecting that public perspectives will conform to a prescriptive ethical framework; (2) ignoring the socio-economic infrastructures that influence individuals’ decisions on whether or not to use neuroenhancement; and (3) overlooking conflicts between fundamental ethical values namely, safety of neuroenhancement and autonomy. We argue that in order to understand neuroenhancement practices it is essential to recognize which values affect individual decisions to use or refuse to use neuroenhancement. Future research on the ethics of neuroenhancement should assess the morally significant values for stakeholders. This will fill the gap between what ought to be done and what is done with an improved understanding of what can be done within a particular context. Clarifying conflicts between competing moral values is critical in conducting research on the efficacy of substances putatively used for neuroenhancement and also on neuroenhancement practices within academic, professional and social environments.},

Focusing mainly on methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and modafinil, the article cites scientific studies indicating that those with a lower baseline of working memory tend to benefit more from cognitive enhancement than those with a higher baseline. Enhancing some cognitive capacities through neurotransmitters may come at the cost of diminishing others and may result in addiction or other pathological behavior. This suggests that an unlimited augmentative conception of enhancement needs to be replaced by one that that involves optimal levels of cognitive capacities to improve performance on specific tasks in promoting flexible behavior and adaptability to the environment. Cognitive enhancement would not likely increase social inequality and would be consistent with authenticity, excellence, and achievement. How cognitive enhancement could be one component of moral enhancement is also discussed.},

	shorttitle = {An educational program for remote training and supervision of home-based transcranial electrical stimulation},
	abstract = {Objective:
There has been recent interest in the administration of transcranial electrical stimulation ({tES}) by a caregiver, family member, or patient themselves while in their own homes ({HB}-{tES}). The need to properly train individuals in the administration of {HB}-{tES} is essential, and the lack of a uniform training approach across studies has come to light. The primary aim of this paper is to present the {HB}-{tES} training and supervision program, a tele-supervised, instructional, and evaluation program to teach laypeople how to administer {HB}-{tES} to a participant and provide a standardized framework for remote monitoring of participants by teaching staff. The secondary aim is to present early pilot data on the feasibility and effectiveness of the training portion of the program based on its implementation in 379 sessions between two pilot clinical trials.

Materials and Methods:
The program includes instructional materials, standardized tele-supervised hands-on practice sessions, and a system for remote supervision of participants by teaching staff. Nine laypersons completed the training program. Data on the feasibility and effectiveness of the program were collected.

Results:
No adverse events were reported during the training or any of the {HB}-{tES} sessions after the training. All laypersons successfully completed the training. The nine laypersons reported being satisfied with the training program and confident in their {tES} administration capabilities. This was consistent with laypersons requiring technical assistance from teaching staff very infrequently during the 379 completed sessions. The average adherence rate between all administrators was over 98\%, with 7/9 administrators having 100\% adherence to the scheduled sessions.

Conclusions:
These findings indicate that the {HB}-{tES} program is effective and is associated with participant satisfaction.

Significance:
We hope that the remote nature of this training program will facilitate increased accessibility to {HB}-{tES} research for participants of different demographics and locations. This program, designed for easy adaptation to different {HB}-{tES} research applications and devices, is also accessible online. The adoption of this program is expected to facilitate uniformity of study methodology among future {HB}-{tES} studies, and thereby accelerate the pace of {tES} intervention discovery.},

Some studies found that {tES} has weak but positive eﬀects on brain physiology, cognition, or assessment performance, which has attracted massive public interest. We present the ﬁrst meta-analytic test of the hypothesis that {tES} in a learning phase is more eﬀective than {tES} in an assessment phase. The meta-analysis included 246 eﬀect sizes from studies on language or mathematical competence. The eﬀect of {tES} was stronger when stimulation was administered during a learning phase (d = 0.712) as compared to stimulation administered during test performance (d = 0.207). The overall eﬀect was stimulation-dosage speciﬁc and, as found in a previous meta-analysis, signiﬁcant only for anodal stimulation and not for cathodal. The results provide evidence for the modulation of long-term synaptic plasticity by {tES} in the context of practically relevant learning tasks and highlight the need for more systematic evaluations of {tES} in educational settings.},

	abstract = {Motor skills can take weeks to months to acquire and can diminish over time in the absence of continued practice. Thus, strategies that enhance skill acquisition or retention are of great scientific and practical interest. Here we investigated the effect of noninvasive cortical stimulation on the extended time course of learning a novel and challenging motor skill task. A skill measure was chosen to reflect shifts in the task's speed–accuracy tradeoff function ({SAF}), which prevented us from falsely interpreting variations in position along an unchanged {SAF} as a change in skill. Subjects practiced over 5 consecutive days while receiving transcranial direct current stimulation ({tDCS}) over the primary motor cortex (M1). Using the skill measure, we assessed the impact of anodal (relative to sham) {tDCS} on both within-day (online) and between-day (offline) effects and on the rate of forgetting during a 3-month follow-up (long-term retention). There was greater total (online plus offline) skill acquisition with anodal {tDCS} compared to sham, which was mediated through a selective enhancement of offline effects. Anodal {tDCS} did not change the rate of forgetting relative to sham across the 3-month follow-up period, and consequently the skill measure remained greater with anodal {tDCS} at 3 months. This prolonged enhancement may hold promise for the rehabilitation of brain injury. Furthermore, these findings support the existence of a consolidation mechanism, susceptible to anodal {tDCS}, which contributes to offline effects but not to online effects or long-term retention.},

Here, we addressed this question by using transcranial alternating current stimulation ({tACS}) over sensorimotor cortex to modulate theta–gamma activity during motor skill acquisition, as an exemplar of a non-hippocampal-dependent task. We demonstrated, and then replicated, a significant improvement in skill acquisition with theta–gamma {tACS}, which outlasted the stimulation by an hour. Our results suggest that theta–gamma activity may be a common mechanism for learning across the brain and provides a putative novel intervention for optimizing functional improvements in response to training or therapy.},
